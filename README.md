# Music Player Application


## Alex Liang | CPSC 210 | 2020W1

For my personal project, I decided to create a music player similar to 
Spotify. This sparked my interest because I listen to music everyday
and my first idea that came to my mind was to create a
functional music player. My application will do the following:


- run and import music files from within user created playlist
- be able to have a functioning play/pause, skip, volume slider,
- anyone can use it, regardless of music tastes
- be able to shuffle the song within the playlist
- a visual to show what song is currently playing
- my love for music and the Spotify application inspired me to create
something similar and to play user-created playlists
